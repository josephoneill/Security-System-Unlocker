# Security-System-Unlocker

PHP implementation of the Color Combination kata.

# Running instructions
Run index.php to run the console app. The user will be prompted for a custom input file. I suggest placing these files
in the assets folder. Sample input files to test already exist within the assets folder, and tests on those files can be run
within the tests/unit folder. The console program will prompt the user if the file inputted does not exist until an existing file
is inputted. The program will then determine whether or not the security input is unlockable or not and will output the results.
